Dessertshop-Web-Template

This is a simple implementation of a webpage for a dessert shop.
I have used basic HTML5, CSS and Javascript.
The descriptions of the desserts are just fill-in lines used.
The uploaded file also includes the images used for the webpage.
The dessert shop does not have a name as this program was purely implemented for the purpose of practise.
